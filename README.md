The schema is the structure described in a formal language supported by the database and provides a blueprint for the tables in a database and the relationships between tables of data. Within a table, you need to define constraints in terms of rows and named columns as well as the type of data that can be stored in each column.

In a document DBMS (database management system), documents can be as complex as you choose; you can use nested data to provide additional sub-categories of information about your object. Also, when utilizing this type of document storage database, you can use one or more documents to represent a real-world object.
